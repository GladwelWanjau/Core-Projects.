Projects tackeld in Moringa's Data Science Core
This is a collection of my Independent Projects during the Moringa Data Science Core Program This first project is an analysis of the Financial inclusion in four countries in East Africa i.e. Rwanda,Kenya,Uganda and Tanzania. The main variable of interest is whether the respondents have a bank account or not. My task was to evaluate the relationships between the independent variables(e.g. age of the respondent,type of lacation,level of Education,etc) and the dependent variable(Having a bank account or not). Once done with identifying the relationships my task was to use these factors to predict the values of the dependent variable.
